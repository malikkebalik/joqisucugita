From "Miss Congeniality" and "The Blind Slide" to the more recent "Bird Box," she has a successful acting career, but she's endured a few ups and downs in her personal life.</p><p class=dh>Sandra Annette Bullock is a name very few won't recognize. The Washington native has made it big time, but her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.insider.com/sandra-bullock-facts-2019-1#she-speaks-german-1>story</a> hasn't always been easy.</p><p class=dh>The daughter of a German opera singer, Sandra, was exposed to the language and singing from a young age. Her formative years were spent on the road, traveling through Germany and America.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amoanimals.com/4700d54b0d9eca8280324bbde039fb8f1695991585921534.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Image Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Image Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She picked up vocal skills early on, and this talent would lead her to find the eventual love of her life, acting. The star chose New York to follow her dreams of a life on the screen.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A BIG AWARD AND A WORLD RECORD</strong></p><p class=dh>After a few attempts in theatre, Sandra decided to try the film industry instead. One of her early <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/things-we-forgot-about-sandra-bullock-actress-films/>breakout</a> roles was "Speed." The movie's fame resulted in a sequel and an array of other big roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amoanimals.com/c7cb4e4c08a8d0a3049509d57ccd01561884041585921911.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Image Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Image Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.insider.com/sandra-bullock-facts-2019-1#she-speaks-german-1>success</a> hit a definite peak in 2009. This was when she took home a coveted Oscar for her role in "The Blind Side."</p><p class=dh>Since then, she hasn't looked back, with amazing performances in "Miss Congeniality," "The Proposal," and "Bird Box," this star's skills have banked her almost $60 million, a Guinness World Record!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amoanimals.com/3670b4cd6e1da4cc7e3db35805e842311651171585921928.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Image Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Image Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HER SECRET TO SUCCESS</strong></p><p class=dh>Bullock has shared some of her thoughts on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/things-we-forgot-about-sandra-bullock-actress-films/>success</a> and how she's kept herself on the top of her game after all these years.</p><p class=dh>Since success comes in a "very prickly package," it's up to the individual to decide what to do with it.
