The unique premise of the reality TV program follows five couples dealing with an ex who is still complicatedly connected to and very much a part of their daily lives.</p><p>Among the cast are Loren Kirk, Roy Kirk, Roy’s ex-wife<a href=#> April Kirk</a>, and <a href=#>John Kirk</a>, Loren’s ex-husband.</p><p>And here’s a Loren Kirk Wiki writing which in detail explains the couple’s situation as a big blended family.</p><p><strong>Read Next:<a href=#> Sha’Carri Richardson Boyfriend, Gender, A Man, Mother</a></strong></p><h3><strong>[You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk Age, Birthday</strong></h3><p>Loren Kirk’s profile on Wife’s Tales&nbsp;mentioned Loren to be “32 years young” before Oct. 2020. At the time, one could not tell when exactly she celebrated her birthday.</p><p>Loren happens to have started on multiple business ventures with her ex-husband’s current wife April Kirk. And Wife’s Tales is among them. It is a blog Loren and April run together sharing their real-life journey through their “divorces, co-parenting, and chaos.”</p><h3><strong>[You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk Maiden Name, Family</strong></h3><p>Loren was born in San Antonio, Texas but grew up in the small town of Powder Springs in Georgia.</p><p>Years after her separation from ex-husband John and Loren still did not let go of his last name. That is the reason why her maiden name stayed a mystery.</p><p>Loren Kirk grew up the oldest of eight children from two blended families. She described her upbringing as the “oh-so-pleasant honors of the oldest, roughly translated into being the Guinea Pig for all my parent’s hair-brained ideas on disciplining and raising a highly spirited child.”</p><p>Thus, growing up, Loren revealed she really broke the molds for her younger siblings.</p><p>More about Loren’s family— Loren’s mom is friends with April’s mom and Loren has a grandmother named Carol J Nichols. Now, living in New Braunfels, Texas, she went to San Antonio College and worked as a certified pharmacy technician at CVS pharmacy.</p><h3><strong>Her Height, Weight</strong></h3><p>Loren Kirk is below 5’7” tall in height and weighed above 55 kg (until recently). She enjoys working out and teaching yoga.</p><p><strong>Related Read: <a href=#>[You, Me & My Ex] Danielle Rappahahn Wiki: Age, Job</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Her Instagram, Facebook</strong></h3><p>Loren Kirk could be spotted on her pages on Instagram and Facebook promoting her latest stint on You, Me & My Ex.</p><p>Also, as the hosts of Co-Parenting Past Chaos, Loren collaborated with April for their TikTok account. The page entertained 436.4K followers and more than 8.2M likes (as of June 21, 2021).</p><h3><strong>[You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk Job</strong></h3><p>Loren Kirk collectively attended four colleges to earn a said degree. She graduated college from the University of Missouri at the age of twenty-eight. There, she received B.S. in Health Sciences with a minor in Psychology. But she herself claimed they mean “absolutely nothing” as they never came in handy to her.</p><p>Instead, after graduation, Loren landed a job in home building and has been working in the industry ever since. “What started as a job, has quickly become a career I see for myself far into the future.”</p><p>Besides, she is also involved with April on their podcast, Co-Parenting Past Chaos. Plus, at the time of this writing, the duo was waiting to release their Wife’s Tales merchandise. And while that was happening, Loren, a single mom with three boys, had an estimated $500K net worth. (Loren had Jack at 22, Jagger at 25, and Jett at 27.)</p><h3><strong>[You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk John, April</strong></h3><p>So, this is how the ‘You, me and my ex’ drama started between Loren Kirk, John, April, and Roy.</p><p>At first, Loren and her ex-husband John were married and had three kids together. And they lived next door to April and her then-husband Roy Farner, who also had three kids.</p><p>Both the couples were having tough times in their marriage and John and April ended up falling in love.</p><p>Loren and Roy felt blindsided by their spouses’ connection, things got “rocky” and eventually both the couples divorced.</p><h3><strong>Who Is [You, Me & My Ex] Loren Kirk Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>A “happily divorced” Loren Kirk had been dating her boyfriend Jake Bublitz since Jan 1, 2020.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-39813 alt=you-me-my-ex-loren-kirk-wiki-age-job-instagram-2021 width=300 height=291 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsoffline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/you-me-my-ex-loren-kirk-wiki-age-job-instagram-2021-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-39813 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Loren Kirk with boyfriend Jake Bublitz on May 26, 2020</strong> (PIC: Loren’s IG)</p><p>Until 2017, the Staff Sgt. was a drill instructor at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.</p><p>Further, Jake also explored life as a singer and songwriter with stage name Jacob Paul / “JP Guhns.”</p><p>‘JP’ is a nickname he has had since childhood.</p><p>A tall and muscled framed native of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, and 33-year-old by Sep. 2020, Jake mostly played Lowcountry gigs.</p><p>Besides, he is also a military man who had his first deployment in Afghanistan as the further career in the Marine Corps awaited him.</p><p>Until 2017, Jake was married to his wife Amanda Bublitza, who also served in Marine Corps. In the fall of 2010, she retired as a sergeant from the Marine Corps. The couple shared two daughters— Zoey, 5, and Kolbie, 2 (ages, as of Sep. 2017).</p><p>In the meantime (i.e. as of Jan 2020), Jake continued to appear on Loren’s Instagram, which tells, Jake and Loren have formed a blended family with their respective kids from previous marriages.</p><p><strong>Also, Don’t Miss: <a href=#>Ahmir Steward Wiki: Jazz Jennings, Transgender, Age</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtLvFn6OippVjsLC5jrKmrmWdmnquxYyer2akn6eyr3nKoqmkZaeeuKp5wKCcZqKfl3qqutKtmKCqkaJ8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fage-job-boyfriend-maiden-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fage-job-boyfriend-maiden-name.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fage-job-boyfriend-maiden-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fage-job-boyfriend-maiden-name.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fage-job-boyfriend-maiden-name.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fage-job-boyfriend-maiden-name.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christopher-comstock-real-name-of-marshmello-age-biography-wiki-career-net-worth-dating-girl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christopher-comstock-real-name-of-marshmello-age-biography-wiki-career-net-worth-dating-girl.html>Christopher Comstock Real Name of Marshmello | Age, Biography, Wiki, Career, Net Worth, Dating, Girl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adam-ian-cohen-tvactor-wiki-age-birthday-biography-height-net-worth.html>Adam Ian Cohen (tvactor) Wiki,Age,Birthday,Biography,Height,Net Worth ..</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adam-ian-cohen-tvactor-wiki-age-birthday-biography-height-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
