アリアナ・グランデさん筆頭に、惜しい破局が続いています。
そんな中、唯一、ハッピーな報告が聞こえてきたのが、
レディー・ガガさんなのです！
レディー・ガガさんといえば、
数年前に結婚秒読みと言われたキニーと破局し、
その後の彼氏・クリスチャンの報道は目立ちませんでした。
最近ではGagaさんの薬指に輝く指輪がはめ込まれ、
「もしかしれクリスチャンと婚約したの？」と憶測されました。
その憶測説は、まさかの正解で、
ついにレディー・ガガさん本人が、
クリスチャン・カリーノと婚約してることを認めたのです。
レディー・ガガの婚約が確定！ ずっと婚約が噂されていたレディー・ガガさんですが、
１０月１５日の雑誌「エル」のイベントに出席し、
スピーチの中で、彼氏のクリスチャンを、
「私の婚約者」と紹介したのです。
２０１７年の２月から始まった恋物語ですが、
婚約に関しては代理人がずっと否定していましたが、
Gagaさんの指輪を見てる限り、
もう隠すことに疲れた感じでした。
しかし、以前の彼氏のテイラー・キニーとは、
婚約しておりながらも、結局は破局することになりました。
まだ、結婚することが決まったわけではないですし、
もしかしたら事実婚という形で長く籍を入れない状況を作るかもです。
それでも前の彼氏のテイラーよりも、クリスチャンさんは大人で渋い感じの人。事実婚なんて形よりも結婚する形を選ぶかもです。
結婚相手はｸﾘｽﾁｬﾝ・ｶﾘｰﾉ 現在、レディーガガさんは３２歳で、
彼氏のクリスチャン・カリーノさんは４９歳です。
１７歳の年の差がありますが、
ガガさんは大人の色気があるクリスチャンさんにぞっこんのようです。
しかし、このクリスチャン・カリーノという方は、
具体的にどのような方なのか、よくわかりませんよね。
クリスチャンさんの仕事はタレントエージェントといって、
事務所に所属するセレブの仕事を管理する仕事をされています。
クリスチャンさんとガガさんは同じ事務所、
CAA（クリエイティブ・アーティスツ・エージェンシー）に所属しており、
仕事パートナーでもあるのです！
日本でいうタレントのマネージャーと変わらない存在のようです。
トレンドの真ん中でガ頑張って、
私生活でも色恋に疲れて、
たどり着いたのが落ち着いた仕事仲間ってのが、
なんとなく納得できますね！
今後は結婚することも考えられるので、
来日やライブツアーでは、
この二人のペアが常に注目されることでしょうね！
ただ、どの現場にも旦那がいるって、
嫌な人は嫌かもしれませんね。。。
女優の仕事の際、彼氏役の俳優がやりにくいかも？？笑
