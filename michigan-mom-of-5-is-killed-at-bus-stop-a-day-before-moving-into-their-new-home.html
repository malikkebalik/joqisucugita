Still, bringing oneself to say goodbye to a loved one and that too, most unexpectedly and painfully, can be nerve-wracking. Keep reading to discover how an unspeakable tragedy turned a family's world upside down.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>Loved by All</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Lari Brisco was a loving mother to five children who were the center of her universe.

Her boss, Dr. Kathleen Dass MD, shared that Brisco made everyone feel special and often showed up early to work to decorate for birthdays.</p><p class=Zg>Brisco, 43, was said to have taken Monday, August 29, 2022, off, so she could move into a new house close to her office. On the morning of Sunday, August 28, <strong class=Xg>the mom-of-five was waiting for a ride at the bus stop</strong> before seven on Livernois when something terrible happened.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>When Tragedy Struck</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>The Michigan receptionist was tragically killed in what the police called a <strong class=Xg>"random shooting spree"</strong> before she could catch the bus. Police believed that the suspect approached random people on the street in at least four locations, out of which only one survived.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>Sadly, Brisco was one of the three victims who lost their lives. </strong>The tragic news devastated everyone who knew her, including Dr. Dass, who never expected to lose her valued employee so unexpectedly.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>A Loving Mother</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Dr. Dass described Brisco as someone who was <strong class=Xg>always full of love, light, and joy</strong> and said that anyone who knew her would be impacted by her loss.
