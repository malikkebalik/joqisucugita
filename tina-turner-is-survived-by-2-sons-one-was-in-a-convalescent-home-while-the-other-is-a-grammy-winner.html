She was diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016, had a kidney transplant in 2017, and suffered from high blood pressure for most of her later life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2fa4ff4b316c74f02f76d110e1a8c8eedc46a43e7f12c3a2b17e3188df395495.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tina Turner smiles during the presentation of the music project 'Beyond - Three Voices For Peace' on May 14, 2009 in Zurich, Switzerland. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Tennessee, Turner found fame in the late 1960s when she collaborated with Ike Turner in the music scene. After getting married in 1962, they separated in 1976 after years of enduring physical and emotional abuse from her husband.</p><p class=dh>With no money to her name, Turner worked hard to make a comeback. By the 1980s, she had one of the biggest comebacks in pop music, bringing the world hit after hit in "The Best," "Private Dancer," and "What's Love Got To Do With It."</p><p class=dh>For years, Turner was on top of the game. She was an international superstar, selling over 180 million records, selling out several world tours in the biggest stadiums, and winning a total of 12 Grammy Awards in her lifetime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/eae52234268129cc6d27e29e1d3d8df2bda2079656080bed467a166339f82e8f.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A portrait of Tina Turner circa 1985. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In 2021, Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a second time for her work as a solo artist. This came 30 years after she was first inducted alongside her ex-husband Ike.</p><p class=dh>Turner's personal life was as eventful as her career. She gave birth to her first son, Craig Raymond Turner, on August 29, 1958. She shared him with saxophonist Raymond Hill.</p><p class=dh>Later on, Turner got into a relationship with Ike Turner Sr., and he ended up adopting Craig. Her son died in July 2018 after taking his own life.</p><p class=dh>The death was a painful one for Turner. She scattered his ashes in the ocean.

Ultimately, she felt loneliness was the reason why her son went off the edge.</p><p class=dh>Tina and Ike Sr. welcomed their only son Ronnie Turner on October 27, 1960. The singer was quite open about raising her son in a privileged way, putting him through private school, giving him lavish allowances, and providing him with everything he needs.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, despite everything being given to him, Ronnie was self-destructive. He suffered from substance abuse, and by 1986, Turner had cut him off financially.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4b81616af21770f116eb94f05b762da7c9dc933c65324c8607f18139a6a364e1.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Tina Turner hugs Shawn Bell, 10, at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital on Friday, Oct. 20, 2000 in Memphis, Tennessee. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Ronnie followed in his parents' footsteps in the music industry.

He followed his parents in the entertainment industry, playing drums and piano as a child.</p><p class=dh>He ended up playing every instrument available to him, save for the horn.
