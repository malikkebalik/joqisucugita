His illustrious journey has not only contributed to his fame but also added to his substantial net worth.</p><p>Born on July 16, 1943, in Port Arthur, Texas, USA, Jimmy Johnson attended Thomas Jefferson High School (now Memorial High School) before pursuing his education at the University of Arkansas. His football career began at the university, where he excelled as a defensive lineman and was named the all-Southwest Conference defensive lineman. Johnson’s outstanding performance led his team to win the national championship in 1964.</p><p>Following his college career, Johnson delved into coaching, starting as an assistant coach at various institutions before landing his first head coaching job at Oklahoma State University in 1979. He later moved on to coach the University of Miami for five years, claiming his first national championship as a coach in 1987. However, his most noteworthy coaching role came when he was appointed as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys in 1989. During his tenure, the team achieved immense success, clinching two Super Bowl victories in 1992 and 1993.</p><p>After his coaching stints, Johnson transitioned to a career as an NFL analyst and commentator, working for Fox NFL Sunday. He also ventured into the culinary industry, establishing the restaurant chain “Three Rings” and the bar “JJ’s Big Chill” in Florida. His achievements in the sports and entertainment industries have significantly contributed to his estimated net worth of over $40 million as of early 2016.</p><p>Johnson’s impact on American football earned him recognition, with ESPN ranking him as the 13th best overall NFL coach. In 2012, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in honor of his coaching prowess. Additionally, he co-authored an autobiographical book titled “Turning the Thing Around: My Life in Football” with ghostwriter Ed Hinton.</p><p>Beyond his professional endeavors, Johnson has made appearances on various television shows and participated in the reality series “Survivor: Nicaragua,” further solidifying his position in the entertainment realm.</p><p>Away from the spotlight, Johnson has experienced personal milestones, including his marriages and family life. He married Linda Kay Cooper in 1963 and later tied the knot with Rhonda Rookmaaker in 1999. Currently residing in Florida, Johnson manages his restaurant and bar in Key Largo, while also contributing to charitable and entrepreneurial activities in the region.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihoqWdrnqru8enqqimXZi8oq%2FHZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-johnson-coach-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjimmy-johnson-coach-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-johnson-coach-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjimmy-johnson-coach-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-johnson-coach-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-johnson-coach-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./larry-david-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./larry-david-hollywood-life.html>Larry David Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./halsey-fans-convinced-she-s-back-together-with-yungblud-6-months-after-their-split.html>Halsey Fans Convinced Shes Back Together With Yungblud 6 Months After Their Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./halsey-fans-convinced-she-s-back-together-with-yungblud-6-months-after-their-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
