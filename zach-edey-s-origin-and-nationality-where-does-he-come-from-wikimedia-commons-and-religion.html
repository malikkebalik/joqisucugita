His sports-loving genes would surely pull him to athletics. Furthermore, his diverse cultural background fostered in him a deep understanding and respect.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>He is a modest person off the court, but in competitive sports, he is a fearsome wall to his opponents. Zach Edey, a Canadian-born basketball player, is presently a center for Purdue University (2020 – now). He joins Brian Waddell, Josh Furst, Camden Heide, and Will Berg on the roster.</p><p>His scoring average jumped from 8.7 to 14.4 points as a sophomore. He then averaged 22.3 points, 12.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks, and 1.5 assists per game in his junior year. It’s no surprise that he was named Big Ten Player of the Year. Edey chose college over the NBA draft in 2023, allowing players like Victor Wembanyama, Brandon Miller, and Scoot Henderson to enter the league.</p><h2><span id=Is_Zachary_Edey_of_Asian_heritage>Is Zachary Edey of Asian heritage?</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Is Zachary Edey of Asian heritage?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> What is Zach Edey’s religion and nationality?</a></li></ul><p>Glen Edey, a Caucasian white father, and Julia Edey, a Chinese mother, are the parents of the Boilermakers’ player. Because Zach is of mixed race, with Canadian-Chinese origins, Edey is half Asian and half white. The mother of the 2023 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award winner was born in Toronto to Chinese immigrants, where she met his father.</p><p>Zach Edey, who is biracial, not only got to experience the range of ethnic distinctions, but he also inherited his mother’s strong work ethic. Not to add that he got some of his height from his mother, who is 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m). She was a talented basketball player in high school who opted to work at her father’s restaurant instead.</p><p>Julia later studied mechanical engineering and took early retirement to support her son’s basketball career. She is currently a stay-at-home mother who enjoys gardening and beekeeping. In addition, in a 2023 interview with CBS, Zach complimented and thanked his mother for instilling in him the discipline of hard labor.</p><p>“Even when no one is looking, she knows everything there is to know about working.” My mother grew up studying on her own and handed that knowledge down to me.” On and off the court, Edey is undoubtedly making his parents proud!</p><h2><span id=What_is_Zach_Edey8217s_religion_and_nationality>What is Zach Edey’s religion and nationality?</span></h2><p>Zach Edey was born on May 14, 2002, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The basketball star, who stands 7-foot-4 and weighs 305 pounds, is of mixed heritage and holds Canadian citizenship. The Leaside High School graduate has not publicly expressed his religious beliefs, although it is presumed that he is Christian.</p><p>Edey was never a basketball devotee, instead preferring baseball and ice hockey. It was most likely because his father was a young baseball teacher. Because of his tremendous height, those two sports were out of the question, thus the best transition was- you guessed it- basketball!</p><p>So he moved from Canada to the United States to improve his basketball skills. He attended IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he was coached by former NBA player Daniel Santiago. He committed to Purdue as a three-star 2020 prospect, and the rest is history!</p><p>In addition to his collegiate basketball games, Zach is a member of the Canadian national basketball team. In the 2021 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup, he averaged 15.1 points and a tournament-high 14.1 rebounds, helping Canada to a bronze medal. He won a bronze medal and a spot in the 2024 Summer Olympics while competing in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup under coach Jordi Fernández.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Kathy Chow Death Rumors & Hoax: Is She Still Alive?
