Parrillo Jr, an was arrested after a woman he kidnapped and held in for a year finally broke free and ran to a seeking help. The woman whose identity has not been revealed was held against her will and made her escape earlier this month.</p><p>Parrillo has been previously held over multiple charges, according to police. While in captivity in 's Burlington County, the accused captor allegedly threatened to kill her family if she broke free and also choked her multiple times, reported the&nbsp; .</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2 class=split>Who is James Parillo?</h2><p>Parrillo, a 57-year-old man from New Jersey has been accused of and threatening her to not leave him. According to the state Attorney General's office, with multiple aliases in other states, he may have been involved in similar abhorrent acts. While his charges are pending, Parrillo is currently being held in jail.</p><p>In the footage from the surveillance camera, the woman who broke free was seen running straight to the gas station. She was followed by a man while she ran to the office. The woman was then seated after she was brought into the back office of the shop. People inside the office kept her separated from the alleged captor.</p><p>"We are reaching out to law enforcement across jurisdictions to identify other people who may have additional information on the defendant. Our investigation is ongoing and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure we bring justice to this survivor," said Attorney General Matt Platkin said,&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>How was the woman kidnapped by Parrillo?</h2><p>At a New Mexico gas station, Parrillo introduced himself as 'Brett Parker, befriended the woman, and asked her for a ride to Arizona. After a consensual relationship for almost a month, the pair ended their relationship a month later while in California. However, the woman was threatened by Parrillo and felt "that she was unable to leave the relationship." He choked her several times and later spent her money on debit cards after he took away her phone, restricting her from contacting her family members while they were together.&nbsp;</p><p>Parrillo who continued to use his alias 'Parker' along with the woman, rented a room in a home in Burlington County's Bass River Township. Following an argument where she was choked by Parrillo, the woman fled the rented place on February 7.&nbsp;</p><p>In a police-filed affidavit of probable cause against the accused kidnapper, one officer mentioned that she ran "away once she had an opportunity." When she broke free and ran into the gas station, the woman explained to two attendants that she was held against her will for a year by 'Parker'. She appeared to have marks on her neck which aligned with her claims of Parrillo choking her multiple times, according to Daily Mail.</p><p>Talking to a local news outlet in New Jersey, service station manager Jaitin 'Bobby' Madaan told the woman "was shaking, she could barely get her words together but she kept saying, â€˜He has kept me against my will for over a year. He kidnapped me."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>What are the charges against Parrillo?</h2><p>When authorities arrived at the scene, Parrillo who followed the woman while she ran to the gas station, refused to reveal his real name, leading to his being taken into custody after he hindered his own apprehension. Later, Parrillo who gave them his real name, also admitted to choking the kidnapped woman the day she broke free. However, he denied giving his DNA sample.</p><p>According to the court documents, the alleged kidnapper was also charged with two counts of criminal restraint, aggravated assault, and obstruction. "The allegations, if proven, demonstrate a level of predatory conduct that poses an extreme danger to anyone who crosses paths with this defendant," said the director of the Division of Criminal Justice, Pearl Minato.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopGisrR5z5qpq6GcobxurcKcrKydlGKworzTqKlmoZ5iu6t5wKupnqukmrFurcWtnKtlm56xr63PqZydZaekuqK6jKGcpZxdnrtuss6rZJplqZqus3nBq6aknV2bv6ax</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-parrillo-horrifying-footage-shows-woman-escaping-nj-man-who-held-her-captive-for-a-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-parrillo-horrifying-footage-shows-woman-escaping-nj-man-who-held-her-captive-for-a-year.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-parrillo-horrifying-footage-shows-woman-escaping-nj-man-who-held-her-captive-for-a-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-parrillo-horrifying-footage-shows-woman-escaping-nj-man-who-held-her-captive-for-a-year.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-parrillo-horrifying-footage-shows-woman-escaping-nj-man-who-held-her-captive-for-a-year.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-parrillo-horrifying-footage-shows-woman-escaping-nj-man-who-held-her-captive-for-a-year.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jordan-holland.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jordan-holland.html>Jordan Holland</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gary-noesner-5-things-to-know-about-the-fbi-negotiator-in-waco.html>Gary Noesner: 5 Things To Know About The FBI Negotiator In Waco</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gary-noesner-5-things-to-know-about-the-fbi-negotiator-in-waco.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
