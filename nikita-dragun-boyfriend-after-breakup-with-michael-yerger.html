She was once involved with Michael Yerger. However, what about the boyfriend of Nikita Dragun in 2021?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Rumor has it that in 2020, she is dating a fashion designer.

Nikita, who turned 25 in January 2021, flirtatiously commented under one of Alejandro’s images, which ignited the rumors of their affair. She commented, “u 18 now right?…asking for a friend,” on a picture that was posted not long after the TikToker turned eighteen. The couple has frequently been seen making flirtatious remarks under each other’s pictures.</p><p>Alejandro Rosario is a well-known TikTok celebrity who has amassed over 5.5 million followers, in case you were unaware. Additionally, Dragun encouraged him to attend her glamorous 25th birthday party, where she published photographs she took with him on Instagram stories. The two later became the subject of a romance rumor after being sighted dining together in Los Angeles.</p><p>But regrettably, Nikita ended any chance of a romance in February 2021 by claiming that she and the popular TikToker were “just friends.”</p><h2><span id=Did_Chase_Stobbe_and_Dragun_Date>Did Chase Stobbe and Dragun Date?</span></h2><p>Nikita Dragun has never hidden her dating status from the public. She is transparent about her relationships and past lovers on Instagram and in her YouTube broadcasts.</p><p>Similarly, in July 2020, there were rumors that Dragun was dating social media personality Chase Stobbe. After Chase uploaded a picture of himself lounging by the pool with Nikita, rumors about their relationship began to circulate online. Their followers thought something was going on between them after seeing the post that was released in early July.</p><p>In addition, Nikita had shared a picture of them during their Miami vacation. Additionally, the creator of Dragun Beauty included a scorching fire emoji in the comment area of one of Chase’s images.</p><p>Moreover, the fact that Nikita shared a picture of herself with him a few weeks after her contentious tweet about her ex-boyfriend Michael Yerger validates their connection.</p><p>Nikita sort of forewarned Michael and his girlfriend Daisy in the June 15 tweet.</p><p>All us fans can do, though, is conjecture until and unless one of the parties comes forth directly with confirmation.</p><h2><span id=Tony_Lopez_and_Nikita_Just_Friends_or_More>Tony Lopez and Nikita: Just Friends or More?</span></h2><p>Nikita Dragun made news in June 2020 because to her connection with Tony Lopez, a popular TikTok user. Frequently on her Instagram feed, Dragun could be seen cuddling up to the TikToker.</p><p>The pair even tagged one another in several social media posts. Additionally, Nikita previously uploaded a picture of herself wearing a necklace with Lopez’s name on it, which further cemented their lustful relationship. It was evident from the activities that they wanted their admirers to believe that they were actually dating.</p><p>Dragun and Lopez don’t seem to be a relationship, though. Upon closely examining Dragun’s social media posts, we discovered that Nikita and Tony are not romantically involved.</p><p>On June 10, Nikita revealed to The Hollywood Fix that her friendship with Lopez was only platonic. “We’re all buddies. We’re simply friends, that’s all,” Dragun remarked.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Yerger_And_Nikita_Dragun_The_Relationship_Of_The_Former_Flames>Michael Yerger And Nikita Dragun: The Relationship Of The Former Flames</span></h2><p>Nikita previously disclosed that she dated model Michael for several months before to their breakup. She claimed that because she was first hesitant to reveal her sexual orientation, their connection took some time to grow.</p><p>But over time, she began to warm up to Yerger, and he reciprocated her feelings. Things started to become serious after the ex-pair became physical after a while.</p><p>“That’s when everything changed and we really had to figure out what it was,” the woman remarked.The pinnacle was reached after I filmed my Dragun Beauty campaign.</p><p>Following the couple’s public release, Michael began to receive a lot of criticism from admirers. Nevertheless, the pair persisted in their relationship regardless of the public’s reaction.</p><p>She even recorded a Q&A video with her partner at the time. In the video, their chemistry seems very mysterious. At the moment, the two were undeniably in love with one another.</p><p>Dragun claimed at the time that not many people had loved her since she changed into a woman, with Michael being the exception. She said that all of her past love partners treated her like a side chick, which is why many of her prior relationships terminated.</p><h2><span id=Why_Did_Nikita_and_Michael_Break_Up>Why Did Nikita and Michael Break Up?</span></h2><p>Nikita said that when things started to go wrong, she and Michael were still going strong in their relationship. That was following Dragun’s discovery that her partner had been using her to further his profession. On camera, she admitted:</p><p>“All I want is for this to not be something I have to deal with.There have been relationships, particularly this one, when I feel like I wonder what would happen if I were simply “regular.”</p><p>Nikita never again felt the same way for Michael after that. They broke up in the middle of 2019.</p><p>According to Nikita, she came to the realization that no one would ever genuinely love her for who she is after the breakup. Perhaps this is the reason she first learned to love herself.</p><p>Michael Yerger, on the other hand, claimed not to have dated Nikita: an abusive relationship?</p><p>Michael offered his version of events on Instagram Stories a few days after Nikita made her sadness public in a 35-minute YouTube video. Michael disclosed in his narrative that they were never romantically involved in the first place.</p><h2><span id=Michael_Yerger_Nikita_Dragun8217s_former_partner>Michael Yerger, Nikita Dragun’s former partner.</span></h2><p>Michael, Nikita’s ex, disclosed that their romance was a charade. Twitter, the source</p><p>At a pub, he said Dragun approached him and requested to feature in one of her YouTube videos. The model further disclosed that he never requested “exposure and recognition” from Dragun.</p><p>He went on to say that he felt uncomfortable but had to give her a hard kiss and dance for YouTube. He said that having to respond to fan queries as though they were a real-life pair was the “boyfriend q&a,” which he considered to be the worst experience.</p><p>Michael went on to say that he had made it known to Nikita that he liked her personally. On the other hand, Nikita tells her that he still loves her.</p><p>In addition, Yerger said that she went to a lot of parties and gatherings with Nikita after referring to him as her “boyfriend” on social media.</p><p>The lengthy statement that Michael posted on his Instagram Stories is captured in this little video.</p><h2><span id=Model_Oscar_Utierre_was_once_dated_by_Nikita_Dragun>Model Oscar Utierre was once dated by Nikita Dragun.</span></h2><p>Nikita Dragun didn’t date during her adolescence, in contrast to most teenagers. Before dating the model Oscar Utierre, she had never dated anyone. Dragun disclosed that she briefly dated Oscar before to their breakup.</p><p>In her “EX BOYFRIEND DOES MY MAKEUP!” YouTube video, Nikita disclosed that she and Oscar had been friends for a considerable amount of time prior to anything developing between them.</p><h2><span id=Are_Bretman_Rock_and_Nikita_Still_Friends>Are Bretman Rock and Nikita Still Friends?</span></h2><p>Early in 2020, there were a lot of reports circulating that Nikita and Bretman Rock were not getting along. In the second episode of her Snapchat series, Nikita Unfiltered, several followers picked her up on the story, stating, “It was awkward seeing Rock at his birthday party after not seeing him for almost “three months.”</p><p>There was no altercation between Nikita Dragun and her friend Bretman Rock.</p><p>The cancellation of a cooperative project with Bretman by Nikita’s management only served to intensify the conflict.</p><p>Despite all of the unofficial chatter, Nikita dispelled the allegations in a tweet by explaining why she was ending her partnership with Rock.</p><p>The tweet reads, “Bretman and I are doing great, by the way!!!” It was obviously a bummer that he had a previous arrangement that prevented the collaboration. Miss Collab will continue to cum. Don’t worry.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>social media star</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Who Is Sonnie Johnson Husband Michael Perkin?
