<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There are very few musicians in the world who enjoy fame as widespread as Raúl Alejandro Ocasio Ruiz, who is more popularly known as Rauw Alejandro. Having made an awe-inspiring entry into the world of music, the singer became beloved quickly and has been awarded numerous times for his accomplishments. Rauw’s passion and skill made him a great judge and mentor in Netflix’s ‘<a href=#>The Signing</a>,’ AKA ‘La Firma.’ With such an impressive music career, it is no wonder that people are eager to know how wealthy the musician is.</p><h2>How Did Rauw Alejandro Earn His Money?</h2><p>Rauw was born on January 10, 1993, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Growing up, the artist had a strong connection to music because his father, Raúl Ocasio, was a Guitarist, and his mother, María Nelly Ruiz, worked as a Backing Vocalist. This meant that Rauw grew up listening to icons like Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Chris Brown. Growing up in Puerto Rico and the mainland US, he became a fan of the R&B and dancehall genres.</p><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=795509 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/what-is-rauw-alejandros-net-worth/rauw-alejandro/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rauw-Alejandro.jpg data-orig-size=1200,675 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Rauw Alejandro" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rauw-Alejandro.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rauw-Alejandro.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rauw-Alejandro.jpg alt width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>During his school years and at the University of Puerto Rico, Rauw was a soccer player with dreams of making it big in the field. However, his athletic career was put on hold after an injury at 20. Rauw did try to be a part of the Premier Development League (PDL) but was unfortunately unable to claim a spot. This prompted the Puerto Rican artist to find an escape by creating his own music, which he started to put on SoundCloud in 2014.</p><p>In 2016, Rauw released his first-ever mixtape, ‘ Punto de Equilibrio.’ In January of the following year, he started to work with Duars Entertainment.

This opportunity boosted Rauw’s career and helped him get noticed by some of the biggest names in the music industry.</p><p>Over the years, Rauw has given the world some fantastic songs that one cannot help but be captivated by. His first single as a lead artist was ‘Toda,’ released in December 2017. It wasn’t until November 2020 that he released his first-ever album, ‘ Afrodisíaco.’ Rauw’s most famous songs that topped music charts in various countries include ‘Todo de Ti’ and ‘Tattoo.’ Known as the King of Modern Reggaeton, he has also had the opportunity to work alongside icons like Shakira and Selena Gomez. For his work, Rauw has been given numerous awards, including the 2021 Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Fusion/Performance, followed by the 2022 Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year.</p><h2>Rauw Alejandro’s Net Worth</h2><p>With over a billion streams on Spotify, there is no doubt about how popular Rauw truly is.
