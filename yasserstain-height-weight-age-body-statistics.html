He created the channel on November 23, 2009, and uploaded his 1st video titled Yasserstain Trailer! very soon after. He began filming comedy sketches with friends from elementary and secondary school who were also YouTubers at the time, some of which were DruggedChicken, ViscTV, and GejmerSaKlise. As there was no monetization in place on YouTube at the time, more and more of his real-life friends appeared in guest or regular roles for fun. It wasn’t until 2015 that Yasserstain became an organized, more serious group of friends that would regularly appear on-screen, after which they upgraded the video quality and began filming 3-7 videos per month.</p><p>They also decided to release “Top 5” form of videos, and added weekly or biweekly Q&A video series under the name “ZBOG SIRA”. Yasserstain also began uploading vlogs, organizing fan meetups and quickly began creating and recording original music videos with the help of DexLik, associated with the Mix Music Company, a musical equipment store, often using suggestions of their viewers. On September 20, 2016, Yasserstain decided to revive an old channel that he created back in 2010, and began uploading Behind The Scenes (BTS), and bloopers, as well as videos that didn’t make it to the main channel. On January 15, 2019, Yasserstain also put into motion a new project, a podcast series named SIROVA PRIČA (RAW STORY), discussing various casual and serious topics. Yasserstain has also amassed a fanbase online with more than 250k followers on Instagram, more than 150k followers on Facebook, and more than 10k followers on Twitter.</p><h3><span style=color:#111;font-family:Roboto,sans-serif;font-size:22px>Born Name</span></h3><p>Milan Inić</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Yasser, Yasserstain</p><figure id=attachment_152472 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-152472 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Yasserstain in an Instagram selfie as seen in May 2019 (Yasserstain / Instagram)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Capricorn</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Serbia</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Novi Sad, Serbia</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Yasserstain attended the oldest secondary school in Serbia,&nbsp;<strong>Karlovci Gymnasium</strong> in Sremski Karlovci, Serbia.
