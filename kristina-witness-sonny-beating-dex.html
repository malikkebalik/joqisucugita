She just wrapped up delivering all the catering for the after-party. Sasha felt so bad she couldn’t attend the wedding, but Lois and Tracy had such a long list of food to prepare for the party she never thought she’d get it done. Sahsa says Yuri and Leo are playing games, and Monica wanted a light dinner, so they have the house all to themselves. She surprises him with some wine from the house that Ned didn’t finish. Cody thinks this is an expensive wine and asks if she’s sure the Qs won’t mind. Sasha says they won’t, and besides, this wine won’t be any good come tomorrow.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cody-sasha-dine-gh-abc.jpg alt="Cody sasha eat GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>They sit down to dinner, and she wonders how the wedding is going. Cody assumes it’s going well, unless the groom got cold feet, or the bride couldn’t say, “I do.” He rambles off a list of what could go wrong. Sasha chooses to believe it went perfectly and can’t wait to see the pictures. Cody goes to grab more wine, and Sasha stops him.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cody-wine-gh-abc.jpg alt="Cody chills GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sasha asks if he has something against weddings. He doesn’t, he just thought it was a cliché for all women to want the big fancy wedding. Sasha asks why it matters. He says if he ever convinced someone to marry him he could never afford to give them the big fancy wedding of their dreams. Sasha says she doubts all women want to get married, or have a big dream wedding, but traditionally the bride’s family pays for the wedding.</p><p><strong>More:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital served up the best wedding in years!</a></p><p>Sasha says sure a big wedding is one way to celebrate love. He is all ears if she has another way. She says she and Brando got married in a garage, and they just wanted to get to the happily ever after part. She notes that obviously didn’t happen. She says a wedding is just one day, but getting the chance to grow old with your best friend lasts a lifetime, or is supposed to.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sasha-stables-gh-abc.jpg alt="Sasha talks about love GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Cody admits he never pondered the ever-after thing, and where he’s from, the long-term thing didn’t seem like an option. Sasha says getting married makes the long term appear to be the natural thing to focus on, but sometimes you are disappointed. Cody notes that getting married to the one you love isn’t bad, but focusing on the short term leaves you open to surprises. Cody gets an idea, runs into the tack room, and brings out a radio. He turns it on and asks Sasha to dance, and she accepts.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cody-sasha-dance-gh-abc.jpg alt="Cody and Sasha dance GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As they dance Sasha thinks she really should be going to help clean up the afterparty. Cody doesn’t exactly push her away, and she doesn’t split either. They continue to gaze into one another’s eyes.</p><p>In the Pentonville showers, an inmate finished washing up and heads out. Brennan is left holding a shiv, and begins to sharpen it on the sink. A large menacing inmate enters, having seen the weapon, and demands he hand it over or he’ll tell the guards. Brennan says no deal and knocks him out with two hits.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brennan-showers-gh-abc.jpg alt="Brennans shank GH" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Brennan then stabs himself in the side, and places the weapon the other passed out inmate’s hand.

Joss tells a bloody Dex they have to get out of there. Kristina is sobbing on her knees with one hand on her belly. Blaze says she has to go to the hospital. Sonny points and says, “When did she come in?” Carly cries to Jason, “Sonny meant to do this?”</p><p><b>Check out the below photo gallery to vicariously attend the <a href=# rel=noopener>big celebration on the set</a>.<br></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvRnpqaqKNkhHR9kmlqaKOinsC1tc2aZLChpKOytL%2BMrKanpqlir6at06KloGWUmsVw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkristina-witness-sonny-beating-dex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkristina-witness-sonny-beating-dex.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkristina-witness-sonny-beating-dex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkristina-witness-sonny-beating-dex.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkristina-witness-sonny-beating-dex.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkristina-witness-sonny-beating-dex.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michel-stern-wife-lisa-kudrow-married-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michel-stern-wife-lisa-kudrow-married-life.html>Michel Stern | Wife Lisa Kudrow | Married Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gerald-grace-obituary-member-of-northern-oklahoma-college-has-passed-away.html>Gerald Grace Obituary, Member Of Northern Oklahoma College Has Passed Away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gerald-grace-obituary-member-of-northern-oklahoma-college-has-passed-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
