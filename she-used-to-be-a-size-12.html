The influencer went from size 12 to size 20 after her dad passed away in 2020 because she turned to food and alcohol during her grief. Nella Rose just had undergone a successful weight loss transformation before she had weight gain because of her lack of self-discipline.</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Nella Rose</strong></a> is a Belgian media personality who is most recognized for when she was the presenter of MTV's Catfish UK alongside <strong>Oobah Butler</strong>. Many might also know her from her <a href=#><strong>YouTube</strong></a> channel where she mostly posts hair and fashion tutorials because that was how she first gained prominence. Anyway, she has gone from being an <a href=#><strong>internet personality</strong></a> to a big-time presenter now.</p><p>Nella Rose has presented the red carpet event at the Brit Awards and she fronts the Channel 4 digital series Tapped Out. And she is currently in the jungle on the 23rd series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. On the show with <strong>Grace</strong> <strong>Dent</strong>, one of the campmates, she had a very vulnerable moment when she opened up about her weight gain and admitted that it was because of her lack of self-discipline. Since then, viewers have been scouring the internet for more deets of her transformation and how she looked before that!</p><p>Also, read the <strong><a href=#>weight gain</a>&nbsp;</strong>stories of <a href=#><strong>Clyde Edwards-Helaire</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a>.</p><h2>Nella Rose's Weight Gain: How Was She Before She Gained Weight?</h2><p><strong>Nella Rose</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@nellarosee</a>) ended up having a massive weight gain in 2020 after the death of her father. She went from being a size 12 (she had reached size 12 following a <a href=#><strong>weight loss journey</strong></a> just before she gained) to size 20.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/11/nella-rose-pic3-1.jpg alt="Nella Rose used to be a size 12 before she had weight gain. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Nella Rose used to be a size 12 before she had weight gain.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Radio Times</strong></p><p>Rose, the youngest (and the least experienced in terms of handling public appearances) participant in this year's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&nbsp;sparked outrage on social media when she went off on <strong>Fred Siriex</strong> after he said that he was old enough to be her father, which people thought was a non-issue. That little spat seems to have affected her from what she said about considering leaving the show during a conversation with <strong>Grace Dent</strong>. She also talked about her weight gain with her and that has taken over the internet.</p><p>Nella Rose allowed herself to share a few moments of vulnerability when she conversed with one of her campmates, Grace. Not only did she admit that she wanted to leave the jungle and that she would have if <strong>Jamie Lynn Spears</strong> had first left, but she also opened up about how she has never completed anything in her life without quitting because she lacked self-discipline. She also said that it was due to her <a href=# rel=noopener>lack of self-discipline</a> that she had a massive weight gain that saw her go from size 12 to size 20.</p><p>It undid everything she did to lose weight. Before she had weight gain, she was a size 12 and it was not just the weight she was. She had worked hard to attain that size because, as a size 16, she was not happy with herself when she was working on fashion campaigns. So, she embarked on a weight loss journey in 2019 by doing intermittent fasting and 30-minute gym sessions daily. Well, that didn't last long because not long after, she had weight gain.</p><h2>Nella Rose Had Weight Gain Because of a Lack of Self-Discipline!</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/11/nella-rose-pic4-1.jpg alt="Nella Rose went from size 12 to size 20 because she lacked self-discipline. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Nella Rose went from size 12 to size 20 because she lacked self-discipline.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: The Sun</strong></p><p>Rose candidly spoke about how she dealt with her father <strong>Kamango Paul Hollela</strong>'s death. She said that she drank booze every day and ate a lot to cope with her grief. It had only been a few years since she lost her mother in 2016 when <a href=# rel=noopener>she lost her dad</a> and she had no idea how to process that. It's not like she could have thrown herself to her work because it was during the pandemic. So, <strong>Nella Rose</strong> threw herself into <a href=# rel=noopener>food and alcohol</a> which led her to have weight gain.</p><p><strong>Lack of self discipline got me from a size 12 to a size 20. Literally, my dad passed and I locked myself in the house for two months and just drank every single day and ate every single day. I gained it all and it was the pandemic. So it wasn't like I was leaving or working. It was like, boom.</strong></p><p>Nella Rose has not undone her weight gain till now. She is still a size 20. And it's not that she has not tried to lose weight and be size 12 again but when she ballooned up, she became really big and that kind of massive change is not easy to reverse. One time, she tweeted that she was tired of working to lose weight, and maybe, since then, weight loss is not her priority.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why is weight gain sooo quick yet weight loss so slow please ðŸ˜¤ a whole month of hard work and I still look the same Iâ€™m tired man ðŸ˜©</p><p>â€” Nella Rose (@nellarose) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 11, 2021</a></p><p>It does not look like Nella Rose is going to look like how she did before her weight gain anytime soon. She seems to be taking her time with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGilnqSclnqzu9KeZJudlqS%2FpnnWnqCgoKRitKK1zWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshe-used-to-be-a-size-12.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshe-used-to-be-a-size-12.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshe-used-to-be-a-size-12.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshe-used-to-be-a-size-12.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshe-used-to-be-a-size-12.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshe-used-to-be-a-size-12.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-olivia-and-rod-still-together-relationship-partner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-olivia-and-rod-still-together-relationship-partner.html>Are Olivia and Rod Still Together, Relationship, Partner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nfl-who-are-josh-butler-parents-father-steven-and-mother-ladrida-what-happened-to-them.html>NFL: Who Are Josh Butler Parents?
