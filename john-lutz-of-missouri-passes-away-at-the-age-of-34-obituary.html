A sports enthusiast, he held a special place in his heart for the Chiefs, the Royals, and the Jayhawks. John was not only an avid sports fan but also a dedicated student and a true friend to many.</p><p>It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of John Andrew Lutz on September 17, 2023, in Saint Joseph, Missouri, at the age of 34. He leaves behind a multitude of family and friends who mourn his loss and cherish the memories they shared with him.</p><p>Kayleigh Lutz shared condolences,</p><p>I am completely heartbroken to share the news that John has passed away. Our final moments with him were nothing short of perfect. With the help of family and friends, we were able to celebrate an early Christmas with the kids. John was decked out in full chiefs attire and enjoyed the game. He had family at his side, and was surrounded with love.<br>John’s funeral is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday at St. Francis.</p><p>John was preceded in death by his grandparents, Betty, John Lutz, and Norman Harrell, his great-uncle David Harrell, and his nephew John Chavez V.</p><p>He graduated with honors from St. Francis Xavier and Bishop LeBlond High School. During these formative years, he found love in Kayleigh, the love of his life. Their love story continued as they tied the knot shortly after John graduated summa cum laude from Missouri Western in 2011.</p><p>Life took a challenging turn when John was diagnosed with brain cancer just before their marriage. He exhibited incredible strength, enduring numerous surgeries and intensive treatments. Despite the odds, he made a remarkable recovery. John and Kayleigh were blessed with three beautiful children: John Jude, Logan James, and Gemma Lorraine. In the summer of 2022, John’s tumor worsened. On September 17, 2023, surrounded by his family and fortified with the Sacraments, he peacefully passed away.</p><p>John will always be remembered for his kindness, his sense of humor, and his unwavering love for family and friends. He fought courageously till the end, leaving a void that will be deeply felt by all who knew him.</p><p>He is survived by his dedicated wife, Kayleigh, and their cherished children; his parents, Barbara and John Lutz; his siblings, Lisa (Warren) Galligher, Stephen Lutz, and Laura (John) Chavez; mother-in-law, Diana King; brother-in-law Fr. Alex Kreidler; sisters-in-law Reilly, Katie, and Murphy King; nieces Charlotte and Annabelle Lutz, Elizabeth Chavez, Adaline Galligher, and nephew Carson Chavez; his grandmother Mary Harrell; and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends. He is preceded in death by his grandparents, Betty and John Lutz, grandfather Norman Harrell, great-uncle David Harrell, and nephew John Chavez V.</p><p>A visitation and rosary were held on Tuesday, September 19, 2023, at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. A Mass of Christian Burial was also held on the same day. Memorials may be made in John’s honor for his children’s education or donor’s choice.</p><p>May John Andrew Lutz rest in eternal peace, and may his memory be a blessing to all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kt7C0zWajrqyqYrynecyiqqynpae2brzArKqeq12WxKLFjJqrZqyYmnqis8Rmpp9lY2l6sK7Irayaqqlk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-lutz-of-missouri-passes-away-at-the-age-of-34-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-lutz-of-missouri-passes-away-at-the-age-of-34-obituary.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-lutz-of-missouri-passes-away-at-the-age-of-34-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-lutz-of-missouri-passes-away-at-the-age-of-34-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-lutz-of-missouri-passes-away-at-the-age-of-34-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-lutz-of-missouri-passes-away-at-the-age-of-34-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nicky-hilton-rothschild-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nicky-hilton-rothschild-bio-wiki.html>Nicky Hilton Rothschild Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-d-brubaker-net-worth.html>James D.
