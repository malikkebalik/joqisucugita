Still, there is one aspect of his life he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">keeps</a> away from the public eye, and that is his relationship with his wife Jessica Gadsden.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Charlamagne Tha God, real name&nbsp;Lenard McKelvey, met Gadsden back when they were teenagers out of South Carolina and started dating when he was just sixteen years old.&nbsp;</p><p>In his critically acclaimed book&nbsp;Black Privilege: Opportunity Comes to Those Who Create It,&nbsp;the radio host revealed that his wife supported him as he chased his radio dreams and during that time she became the mother to his three daughters. That being said, their relationship was no fairytale either.&nbsp;</p><h2>They Got Married for Their Kids</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>McKelvey has gone on record to admit that he has not always been faithful to his dear wife, although their relationship has been a long-lasting one. Despite the bumpy road, the two got married in 2014 after one of his daughters questioned their relationship.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per a report from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Inquistr</a>, he revealed that one of the reasons that he tied the knot was for his kids.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When you have your 7-year-old daughter asking why you and mommy don’t have the same last name, that affects you as a man.</p><p>And despite having known and watched each other grow since his teenage years, it is still hard for him to believe that he is married to his high school sweetheart.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>He Keeps Family Away from the Limelight</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As much as he loves his wife and daughter, the father of three <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">refuses</a> to let his family appear on social media.
