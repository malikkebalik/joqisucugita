When he’s not in the spotlight on the big and small screens, he’s spending time with his devoted wife, <strong>Jo Green</strong>, whom he’s been married to for over 33 years. The lovebirds also started a family together and remain closely bonded despite the time that’s gone by.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find out more about Jo and her romance to Hugh here.</p><h2>Jo was once a theatre administrator.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although not much is known about Jo, it has <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been reported</a> that she once worked as a theatre administrator. It’s unclear what her duties were exactly, but the theatre work directly connects her to the acting industry, which Hugh has been working in since the early 1980s. It may have been the common interest that led to their romance.</p><h2>How did Jo and Hugh meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hugh-laurie-wife-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The lovebirds reportedly met while she was working as a theatre administrator and it led to a relationship. The romance apparently started before Hugh stepped into a big spotlight in the BBC comedy, A Little Bit Of Fry And Laurie, with his partner <strong>Stephen Fry</strong>. It led to a serious bond and eventually, an engagement.</p><h2>When did Jo and Hugh get married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Hugh married Jo in London, England on June 16, 1989. His partner, Stephen, was his best man in the ceremony. Once they got hitched, based their home life in London as Hugh continued to go forward with his rising acting career.</p><h2>How many kids do they have?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hugh-Laurie-Jo-Green-ev-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Hugh and Jo have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three children</a> together. Their oldest child, <strong>Charlie</strong>, was born before they married, in 1988. Their second oldest, <strong>Bill</strong>, was born in 1991, and their youngest child and only daughter, <strong>Rebecca</strong>, was born in 1992. Most of Hugh and Jo’s children have remained out of the spotlight, but Rebecca has followed in her father’s footsteps by acting in one film as a child, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDB</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When filming his hit television show, House M.D. in Los Angeles, CA from 2004 until 2012, he was away from his family, who remained in London, for most of each year. He spoke about how difficult it was to not see his children during that time in his life, in an interview with the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Daily Record</a> in 2012.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“It’s a very difficult thing [being so far from my kids],” he told the outlet. “I constantly marvel at how grown-up my children are, how grown-up they’re being about this. I worry about parenting at this sort of distance, but they are being so generous and so cool about it that. I mean, it might be because they’re English, and they won’t reveal their psychological damage until they’re in their late forties.”</p><h2>What Hugh has said about his wife.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Hugh has spoken about Jo in numerous interviews over the years, including in 2010, when he was at the height of his success on House M.D. and had to live away from her for most of the year. He told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a> about how the time apart had affected their marriage. “I wouldn’t say that doing the series has made my marriage easier. Better? I don’t know about that either,” he explained. “Doing weekly TV is like joining the Navy and going on the other side of the world for ten months of the year.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“But the truth is that whatever challenging situation you’re in, somebody somewhere has got a much more extreme version,” he added. “So I think one ought to shut up and not moan about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8eunqFlnJbCs7XEZq6inpVignGBj2lna2c%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffind-out-more-about-her-their-marriage-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffind-out-more-about-her-their-marriage-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffind-out-more-about-her-their-marriage-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffind-out-more-about-her-their-marriage-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffind-out-more-about-her-their-marriage-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffind-out-more-about-her-their-marriage-hollywood-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meet-samuel-nowlin-reeves-jr-and-patricia-taylor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meet-samuel-nowlin-reeves-jr-and-patricia-taylor.html>Meet Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr. and Patricia Taylor</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./andrew-tate-turns-irate-after-loverboy-conversation-with-piers-morgan-internet-dubs-top-g.html>Andrew Tate turns irate after loverboy conversation with Piers Morgan, Internet dubs Top G</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./andrew-tate-turns-irate-after-loverboy-conversation-with-piers-morgan-internet-dubs-top-g.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
