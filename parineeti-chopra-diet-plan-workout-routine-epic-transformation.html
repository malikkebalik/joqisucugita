Charming and vivacious actress has joined the league of sexy and curvy actresses after shedding a load of weight. The hot babe candidly admits that she was being overweight when she entered into Bollywood. However, she was highly uncomfortable with her weight because she could not wear sexy and skinny clothes of her choice. Sleeveless and belly revealing clothes were off of her list only because she didn’t wish to put her flabby arms and belly on display. Moreover, her profession being linked with looks and personality urged her to shed unsolicited weight. Having made her mind to become slim, the stunner decided to bring changes in her workout and diet routine. Let’s have a look at the alterations she did, which brought her in slender shape.</p><h3><strong>Pruned Consumption of Junk Food</strong></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/parineeti-chopra-eating-diet.jpg alt="Parineeti Chopra eating her diet" width=640 height=362 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Parineeti being a foodie would splurge on foods of all kinds and due to weak metabolism, her body didn’t take long to reflect the foods consumed by her. She herself admits that her love for pizza, burger etc. was so much that she could not even think of living without them. However, having witnessed the impact of foods on body, Parineeti was left with no other way but to cut back the consumption of pizza and other junk foods. While embracing healthy eating habits, the youthful star added myriad nutrient dense foods in her diet.
