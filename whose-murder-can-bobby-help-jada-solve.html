<time>24 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><i>Please note that if you purchase something by clicking on a link within this story, we may receive a small commission of the sale.</i></p><p>At home on the 4th of July, Paulina tells Abe she’s relieved she’s not responsible for Chanel’s miscarriage, but she’s still so sad for her and Johnny. At least they’re not moving to L.A., Abe says. They realize it’s time for <i>Body & Soul</i>, but discover the news on in its place.</p><p>On the phone at home, Marlena tells Johnny how sorry she is about the baby. When she hangs up, Steve comes by. He turned himself in for helping Clyde escape, but he left John and Ava out of it. However, Jada doesn’t buy it, so she could come around asking questions. He thought John would be back from Greece by now. Marlena relays they haven’t even been able to talk on the phone and their texts have been terse. She worries he doesn’t want to come home. She doesn’t think Steve knows this, but before John left for Greece, he tried to kill him. Steve gapes.</p><p>Stephanie marches into the police station to urge Jada to talk to Bobby. She might be the only one to convince him to let Everett out. Meanwhile, in his hospital room, Bobby stashes his meds. He’s happy just the way he is — with Everett out of the way for good.</p><p><i><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>AnnaLynne McCord previews Days’ mystery role</a></i></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chad-julie-horton-house-days-jj.png alt="Chad and Julie share an emotional look" width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the Horton House, Julie encourages Chad to stop looking at the video on his laptop. Chad says it’s all he can think about. “Is that you, Abby?” he asks the grainy footage of a blonde woman. “Are you out there somewhere?” Chad shuts his computer. He used to know the way Abby moved, but now he can’t remember. He should know if that is his wife or not. Julie says that’s exactly what Clyde wanted… to drive him crazy. Chad recalls the night he found Abigail and how, later at the hospital, Kayla told him she was gone. But could Kayla have missed something? Julie suggests he talk to her.</p><p>Paulina leaves for the office as Abe grumbles about <i>Body & Soul<i>. </i></i>Kate comes by and informs him that his favorite soap wasn’t just pre-empted — it was canceled. She knows how important the show was to him while he was recovering.</p><p>Stephanie meets Paulina in the Square. People aren’t happy with the way Paulina replaced D.A. Trask, a woman of color, with EJ, a corrupt rich white man who was previously fired from that very positon. They are saying she treated Melinda like trash.</p><p><i><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>How Days solved its Johnny problem</a></i></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/steve-confide-marlena-days-jj.png alt="Steve earnestly faces a stone faced Marlena on her couch." width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the townhouse, Marlena recounts to Steve how The Pawn card triggered John at Maggie’s wedding. He picked up a gun on Konstantin’s orders, unsure what to do. She thinks he’s staying away because he doesn’t want to hurt him. Steve declares he has to be the one to bring him home then. If he gets probation, of course. John would never be in this mess if it weren’t for him. “I owe him my life.”</p><p>Bobby reads a book as Jada comes to his room. Beaming, he explains he’s reading a murder mystery she recommended. He assumes Dr. What’s Her Face or Everett’s neurotic girlfriend sent her over. Jada tells him they’re all worried about him. She realizes he had no control over the things she blamed him for. She tears up as he says he never stopped loving her and never meant to hurt her. He asks if they can get past it. She accepts his apology and says she still cares about him.</p><p><i><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Chicago Med characters who *are* returning</a></i></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bobby-smirk-reading-days-jj.png alt="In his hospital bed, Bobby holds a book titled, The Remaining Soul. He looks to the side with a smirk." width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Bobby hardens upon realizing Jada’s there for Everett. She reminds him she’s with Rafe now and that Everett is his host personality while he is an alter. Bobby gets defensive, shouting about the horrors he’s protected Everett from. Jada calls him heroic and strong, but maybe a little too strong. Maybe if he lets Everett out to face the truth, he’d be helping Bobby.</p><p>Chad comes to Kayla’s office at the hospital. He asks her to keep this between them as he shows her the footage of the mystery woman. She can’t tell if it’s Abigail or not. Since Kayla was the last person with Abby before she died, Chad asks if it’s possible that she could be alive. Kayla says maybe.</p><p>Still at the penthouse, Steve gets a call from Justin, who tells him he got a suspended sentence and one hundred hours of community service. Steve tells Marlena that since he’s not on bail anymore, he can go to Greece. Marlena is grateful and knows John will be too.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1338-x-374-Days-of-Our-Lives.png alt="Text reads, Subscribe to Soaps' Days of Our Lives Newsletter.

They’ll launch a campaign that makes EJ look heroic. For example, freeing Gabi to right his wrong of putting her in jail in the first place. They’ll schedule a press conference about it, but it can also be used to highlight Paulina’s accomplishments and plans for the future. Paulina worries it will come off as disingenuous. Stephanie suggests having EJ give the press conference instead since he’s never shy about bragging. Paulina agrees.</p><p>In Bobby’s room, Jada tries to convince him that letting Everett out is what’s best and that he’ll always be a part of him. Bobby counters he can help her solve a crime. But if Everett comes back, she’ll never know the truth. She asks why kind of crime. Nothing too serious, he gleefully says. Just murder.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bobby-jada-face-off-days-jj.png alt="Bobby intensely leans toward a glowering Jada." width=1024 height=598 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><i><b>More:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Could *this* returning character be Li’s killer?</a></i></p><p>At Abe’s place, Kate muses <i>Body & Soul’s</i> cancelation could be good for them. Abe laments never knowing how the storylines will wrap up. “Or,” Kate says, “maybe we <i>will</i> know.” Instead of creating a whole new show, they should buy the rights to <i>Body & Soul</i>.</p><p>At the hospital, Kayla recounts to Chad the many Salemites who have supposedly died and come back, so nothing is impossible. Dr. Rolf aside, there are drugs that can slow breathing and heart rate, mimicking death. She recalls that an autopsy was never performed, but the funeral home would have had to embalm her. There’s only one way of knowing if that really happened.</p><p>After Chad’s left, Steve comes to Kayla’s office. He relays that he won’t have to do any jail time, but he’s going to Greece for John.</p><p>Stephanie comes to Marlena’s place to tell her Jada is with Everett right now. Meanwhile, Bobby tells Jada to come see him tomorrow. They can talk about the murder then. He returns to his book.</p><p>In the Square, Paulina leaves a message for EJ as Chad comes by her table. He needs her permission to exhume his wife’s body.</p><p>Next on Days of Our Lives, <a href=# rel=noopener>Justin offers Alex advice</a>, and Maggie surprises Xander.</p><p><strong>Blake Berris isn’t the only one to play more than one role on the same soap.
