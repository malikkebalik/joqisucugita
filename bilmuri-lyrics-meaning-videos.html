The lyrics "Nothing means nothing, man nothing" emphasizes that the relationship has no value and that there is no worth in continuing the relationship. The line "It doesn't matter, my blood is spilled" indicates that the singer has been hurt deeply, but they are still holding on to the relationship. They feel numb and callous towards the situation, and they don't want to be dragged down into the darkness anymore.</p><br><p>The singer expresses that they are never good enough for their partner, who wants to control and suffocate them. The line "On top of your pedestal, I was holding out for a miracle" illustrates that the singer was hoping that things would change or that their partner would treat them better. However, they realize that they need to let go and move on from the toxic relationship.</p><br><p>The chorus repeats the declaration that the singer is not good enough for their toxic partner, and they need to let go. The line "I am the cream, yeah, the cream of the crop" seems to be a reference to WWE wrestler Randy Savage's catchphrase "I am the cream, and the cream rises to the top." The song ends with a repeated declaration to let go and move on from the toxic relationship.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines
