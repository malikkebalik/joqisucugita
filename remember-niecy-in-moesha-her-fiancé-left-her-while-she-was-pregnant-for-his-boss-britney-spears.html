However, many people don’t know that Federline betrayed Jackson and left her while she was pregnant with their kid.</p><p class=dh>Jackson is the proud mom of Kori Madison and Kaleb Michael, whom she shares with actor, dancer, reality star and DJ, Kevin Federline, who first rose to fame for his relationship with <a class="me a" href=#>Britney Spears</a>.</p><p class=dh>Although these days the former couple has a good relationship, back in 2003 they were at war for each other.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Shar</a> and Kevin dated for three years and were engaged. By the time he decided to leave her, she was in the last stage of her pregnancy with their second child, Kaleb.</p><p class=dh>Kevin’s very public relationship and sudden marriage to Spears ridiculed Shar, and the situation sparked a lot of interest on the media, as people started to call Federline a gold digger that was only trying to piggyback off Spears’ fame and money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/6e05046845a5d707500b60597d1e96951107321556279122.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Britney Spears and Kevin Federline arrive at the 2006 Grammy Nominees party with Kanye West, | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=dh>Back then, Jackson talked about her ex-fiancé's affair saying that "it wasn't like just breaking up a relationship. It was like breaking up a family."</p><p class=dh>Federline and Spears had two sons, Jayden and Sean, and they eventually divorced in 2007. A year later, he married former volleyball player Victoria Prince, and they welcomed their first child together in 2011.</p><p class=dh>Jackson was contacted by People that year to know her opinion about Kevin expecting another child with yet another woman.</p><p class=dh>“Honestly, I wish them the best, without question,” she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/kevin-federlines-ex-shar-jackson-wishes-him-the-best/>said</a>. “It’s just not part of my life- I’ve got my own family to worry about, I can’t really be worried about what’s going on with anybody else. Good for them, and of course I wish them well.”</p><p class=dh>However, it was in 2010, when both Kevin and Shar appeared on the reality show “Celebrity Fit Club,” that Jackson finally received an apology from her ex.</p><p class=dh>“I know I've caused you a lot of pain. I've been really selfish. I guess I got so wrapped up in all this other s*** that I never really got a chance to sit back and apologize to you. I really do want you to know that I am sorry.”</p><p class=dh>"!t felt like the whole relationship was not real by the way you handled it ending - and that killed me,” a tearful Shar <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1263919/Celebrity-Fit-Club-Kevin-Federline-apologises-ex-fiancee-Shar-Jackson-relationship-Britney-Spears.html>replied</a>. “That wasn't it. At all,” Kevin insisted. “I think I got caught up in my own selfishness. When you're in a moment like that you don't really think about anyone else.”</p><p class=dh>The pair <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1263919/Celebrity-Fit-Club-Kevin-Federline-apologises-ex-fiancee-Shar-Jackson-relationship-Britney-Spears.html>ended</a> the discussion with a hug, giving the reality TV producers the entire storyline of love and redemption.</p><p class=dh>Now, each is focused on their families, but because they share kids, Jackson, Federline and even Spears, will be into each other’s lives for a while.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmprcG9mZnqzscyepJudomK7qrHCsmSmp5WotaJ5x56pZp6ZlruksYylnJ%2BsXZ2yb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fremember-niecy-in-moesha-her-fianc%25C3%25A9-left-her-while-she-was-pregnant-for-his-boss-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fremember-niecy-in-moesha-her-fianc%25C3%25A9-left-her-while-she-was-pregnant-for-his-boss-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fremember-niecy-in-moesha-her-fianc%25C3%25A9-left-her-while-she-was-pregnant-for-his-boss-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fremember-niecy-in-moesha-her-fianc%25C3%25A9-left-her-while-she-was-pregnant-for-his-boss-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fremember-niecy-in-moesha-her-fianc%25C3%25A9-left-her-while-she-was-pregnant-for-his-boss-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fremember-niecy-in-moesha-her-fianc%25C3%25A9-left-her-while-she-was-pregnant-for-his-boss-britney-spears.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rome-odunze-bio-age-height-weight-family-hometown-career-college-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rome-odunze-bio-age-height-weight-family-hometown-career-college-and-more.html>Rome Odunze Bio: Age, Height, Weight, Family, Hometown, Career, College, and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-did-joanna-merlin-die-broadway-star-and-law-order-actress-was-92.html>How did Joanna Merlin die?
