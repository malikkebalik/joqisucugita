As a junior in 2010, he had 810 receiving yards and 23 touchdowns. He finished second for the Gatorade Maryland Player of the Year.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Stefon Diggs Children: Meet Nova Diggs</a></h4><p>He accumulated 277 yards rushing and three more scores as a senior, in addition to 770 yards receiving and eight touchdowns. He also saw action on defense, tallying 31.5 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, and one sack.</p><p>He was chosen for The Washington Post’s first team All-metro at wide receiver and The Montgomery Gazette’s All-county team as a result of his efforts. He was selected to participate in the 2012 U.S. Army All-American Bowl after winning MVP honors in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Junior Combine following his senior year.</p><p>Diggs participated in track and field as a sprinter. He finished seventh in the preliminary round of the Bill Carver T&F Classic in the 100-meter sprint in 2011 with a time of 12.00 seconds, and he also helped his team achieve third place in the 4 x 200-meter relay with a time of 1:32.10 minutes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Fellow NFL players Kendall Fuller and Blake Countess, as well as 400m sprinter Sean Sutton, made up the relay team. At the Darius Ray Invitational as a senior, he posted a personal-best time of 22.30 seconds in the 200-meter dash and raced the third leg of the 4 x 100-meter relay team, which helped the Falcons rank second with a time of 43.50 seconds.</p><p>Diggs, a unanimous five-star recruit, was thought to be among the finest players in the country. He was regarded by Rivals.com as the top recruit in the state of Maryland and the second-best wide receiver recruit overall.</p><p>ESPN.com classified him as the No. 3 athlete in the class of 2012 and the No. 13 prospect in the country. He was ranked as the No. 2 wide receiver prospect in the country by Scout.com.</p><p>On February 10, 2012, Diggs decided to attend the University of Maryland in order to be close to home. Among others, he had scholarship offers from Florida, USC, Cal, Ohio State, and Auburn.</p><p>Diggs got a sports scholarship to attend the University of Maryland in College Park, where he participated in football from 2012 to 2014 for the Maryland Terrapins under coach Randy Edsall.</p><p>The Minnesota Vikings selected Diggs with the 146th overall pick in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He agreed to a four-year, $2.5 million contract with a guaranteed signing bonus of $227,000.</p><p>The Vikings’ first three games of the season saw Diggs sit out. Due to the injuries to receivers Charles Johnson and Jarius Wright, he was given his first opportunity to play against the Denver Broncos in Week 4. He answered with six catches on ten targets for a team-high 87 yards in Minnesota’s 23-20 loss in Denver.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Diggs took full advantage of the opportunity to make his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 6 to become the first Vikings receiver to record a 100-yard game since Week 14 of the previous season, finishing with seven catches for 129 yards, including a 30-yard reception on a crucial third-down.</p><p>Diggs officially replaced teammate Mike Wallace as the starting wide receiver against the Detroit Lions in Week 7. With six receptions for 108 yards, Diggs recorded his second straight 100-yard performance. In the third quarter, Diggs outmuscled veteran CB Rashean Mathis with a double move before setting up to make a highlight-reel 36-yard touchdown catch in the end zone.</p><p>On nine targets in the Vikings’ season-opening contest against the Tennessee Titans on September 11, Diggs led the team with seven receptions for 103 yards. The Vikings were forced to throw more than anticipated because the Titans stifled the running game, despite the fact that Diggs was listed as the team’s No. 2 wide receiver behind Charles Johnson. Diggs also led the team in targets, receptions, and yards.</p><p>Diggs has seven receptions for 93 yards and two touchdowns on September 11, 2017, the first Monday Night Football game of the season against the New Orleans Saints. Diggs had a great effort in Week 3 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, recording 173 receiving yards and two touchdowns as the Vikings prevailed 34-17.</p><p>Diggs extended his deal with the Vikings for five years and $72 million on July 31, 2018, extending it through the 2023 campaign. Kirk Cousins’ first touchdown pass as a Viking was grabbed by Diggs in Week 1’s 24-16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Diggs caught one catch for a 49-yard touchdown in the Vikings’ 21-16 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 2. Diggs caught seven catches for 108 yards in Week 4’s 16-6 loss to the Chicago Bears.</p><p>Diggs and the Vikings’ seventh-round pick were dealt to the Buffalo Bills on March 20, 2020, along with their first, fifth, and sixth-round picks in the 2020 NFL Draft and a fourth-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft (Janarius Robinson).</p><p>The Bills added seasoned receiver Emmanuel Sanders during the offseason to help Diggs in the passing game. In week four’s matchup with the Houston Texans, Diggs recorded his first game of the year with over 100 receiving yards.</p><p>Diggs extended his contract with the Bills for four additional years and $96 million on April 6, 2022, through the 2026 campaign. Diggs hauled in eight passes for 122 yards and a score of 53 yards in Week 1’s 31-10 victory over the Los Angeles Rams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Stefon Diggs’ parents?</h2><p>Diggs was born to Stephanie Diggs and Aron Diggs.
