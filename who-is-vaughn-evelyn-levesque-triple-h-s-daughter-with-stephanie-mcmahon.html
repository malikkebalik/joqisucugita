Her birth sign is Virgo and she is a predominantly white Caucasian American citizen who can also trace her bloodline to Irish ancestors through her mother.</p><p>She is the youngest of the three daughters born to former WWE superstar Paul Michael Levesque popularly known by his ring name of Triple H. The former pro wrestler had Vaughn with his wife of over two decades Stephanie McMahon.</p><h2><b>Vaughn Evelyn Levesque’s Parents got Married in 2003</b></h2><p>Many fans easily recognize Vaughn’s parents as the WWE’s ultimate power couple. They are not wrong and the relationship between her parents has its origins in a WWE script. In 2000, Triple H and Stephanie had to play pretend couple for viewer entertainment.</p><p>That relationship turned into something tangible and they soon began dating each other exclusively. On February 14, 2003, Triple H asked Stephanie to marry him, and she agreed. Wedding preparations started in earnest and every effort toward the ceremony culminated in a wedding that took place at St. Teresa of Avila Church, a Roman Catholic church located in Sleepy Hollow, New York.</p><p>Vaughn’s parents’ wedding took place on October 25, 2003, and they have been together for a few 2 decades. It wasn’t always that way though as Triple H had just ended a four-year (1996 -2000) relationship with former wrestler Joanie “Chyna” Laurer. She even speculated that her relationship with HHH was far from over before he hooked up with Stephanie.</p><h2><b>Vaughn Evelyn Levesque’s Family is WWE Royalty</b></h2><p>Vaughn Evelyn Levesque has had to deal with the inevitable scrutiny that comes with being a celebrity child. One of the outcomes of her status is that she has had to live the majority of her existence under media and public scrutiny.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Mcmahon-family.jpg alt="Vaughn Evelyn Levesque" width=696 height=397 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The primary reason for the spotlight arises from the fact that most members of her immediate and extended family, are well-known public figures. Her father as we have already established, had a stellar career in the WWE, winning 14 world titles, and a host of other individual titles and team titles.</p><p>He was also one of the founders of one of the most fearsome groups in WWE history known as D-Generation X, alongside fellow superstars Shawn Michaels, Ricky Rude, and ex-girlfriend Chyna. His wrestling career was inspired by watching Chief Jay Strongbow wrestling as a child.</p><p>In 2019, Vaughn’s father was named to the WWE hall of fame as a member of the iconic D-Generation X. He retired 3 years later in 2022, and his role in the industry would change soon after as he has since become the Executive Vice President of Talent Relations, a position he was promoted to on July 22, 2022.</p><p>Evelyn’s maternal grandfather Vince McMahon who is also a well-known wrestling promoter retired a few days after her father and took up the vacated position as Head of WWE Creative. Vaughn Levesque’s father also became Chief Content Officer of WWE on September 2, 2022.</p><p>Her mother Stephanie Marie McMahon has also left her mark on the WWE industry as a wrestler and as a chief executive. She was the WWF Women’s Champion at one point in her career before going on to hold several positions, including the SmackDown General Manager and Raw General Manager at different times. These days, Vaughn’s mother serves as the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairwoman of the WWE brand.</p><h3><strong>Vaughn Evelyn Levesque is Also Related To Other </strong><strong>Other WWE Stars</strong></h3><p>Aside from her very illustrious parents, Vaughn Levesque has the unique privilege of counting a couple more WWE stars as family members. For starters, her maternal grandfather, Vince McMahon established the WWE (formerly WWF) brand with his ex-wife and Vaughn’s maternal grandmother Linda Edwards McMahon. Together they gave birth to Vaughn’s mother and her older brother Shane McMahon.</p><p>We’ve already discussed Stephanie’s involvement in the industry but it is also important to note that Vaughn’s uncle Shane did his bit for the brand as a pro wrestler before assuming his current position as Co-Chief Executive Officer of the WWE brand alongside his sister Stephanie. His children and Vaughn’s cousins, Rogan, Declan, and Kenyon Jesse McMahon all also appear to be joining the industry as pro wrestlers having made ring appearances with their father on several occasions.</p><h3><b>Vaughn Evelyn Levesque Has Two Elder Sisters</b></h3><p><span>Before her parents gave birth to her, they already had two older daughters, both of whom Vaughn adores. Her older sister </span>Aurora Rose Levesque<span> was born on July 24, 2006. Vaughn’s 17 year-old older sister has already indicated her interest in following in her parents’ footsteps by joining the family business.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In an interview a few years back, Vaughn’s mother Stephanie revealed that her oldest daughter was already going through the training required to make the transition to professional wrestling. Vaughn’s immediate older sister Murphy Claire Levesque was born on July 28, 2008. Unlike Aurora though, it would appear that Murphy has no interest in becoming a professional wrestler.</p><p>Given her current age, however, that perspective is likely to change as time goes on. Vaughn enjoys a lovely relationship with her siblings, one that is built on love and companionship.</p><h3><b>She is Active on Social Media</b></h3><p>Vaughn just recently became active on social media under the Instagram handle @<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">vaughn_evelyn_levesque</a>. She has just over 300 followers as of the time of writing and her posts reflect her love and interest in the family business.</p><p>As far as careers go, Vaughn has all the time in the world to decide although it looks ever increasingly likely that she would become a pro wrestler like most members of her family. An assumption that has been confirmed by her mother after seeing Vaughn stage mini matches in their home as a child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdq662s8enZJ6ulaHGr3nLnq2eq6Gqsm7A0aKnpZ1dncBusMCunqGslad6uLXToWSsrJWltaK6yJ5kppudlrWwuo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-h-s-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-h-s-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-h-s-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-h-s-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-h-s-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-vaughn-evelyn-levesque-triple-h-s-daughter-with-stephanie-mcmahon.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cissy-lynn-career-husband-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cissy-lynn-career-husband-and-net-worth.html>Cissy Lynn | Career, Husband And Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./t-i-s-son-s-birthday-party-how-new-gf-bernice-burgos-caused-drama-hollywood-life.html>T.Is Sons Birthday Party How New GF Bernice Burgos Caused Drama Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./t-i-s-son-s-birthday-party-how-new-gf-bernice-burgos-caused-drama-hollywood-life.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
