He worked diligently for a year and was hoping for a big raise. When he got a raise of less than what he had expected, he was disappointed and planned to quit. He was persuaded to stay by an executive, Reuben Gutoff, and reluctantly agreed. An incident that happened in 1963 almost cost him the job. There was an explosion at a factory building under his management and he was almost fired for that, he continued working for GE and was made the vice president and head of GE’s entire plastics division in 1968.In 1971, Welch also became the vice president of GE’s metallurgical and chemical divisions. In 1973, he was appointed as the head of strategic planning for GE.

Curiously, some now ask, what blame, if any, does Welch share in the disaster?The only mistake Welch made was in picking the weakest of three potential successors. It is, surely, the biggest management error of Welch’s career.</p><p class=p-text>Much has already been made of the more than $175 billion of acquisitions made by Immelt, none of which hit the jackpot, many of which were disasters. Imagine buying one of the country’s largest subprime mortgage companies in 2004, or acquiring a coal-fired, steam turbine business for more than $12 billion in 2015 when it was clear you were buying dying technology.</p><p class=p-text>It was Immelt, too, who bought back more than $100 billion of GE shares at a cost that was well above current stock prices. And it was Immelt who kept paying shareholders’ dividends when GE could no longer afford them.Within Welch’s GE, there was an accepted belief that GE Capital, the company’s highly successful financial arm, should never exceed 40 percent of GE’s profits or revenues. This was thought to be a delicate balance, the ideal level to enhance the industrial businesses and to retain the company’s once pristine Triple-A credit rating. Undaunted, Immelt grew it to 55 percent of the company’s portfolio, just at the onset of the Great Recession, ignoring this long-held belief. It didn’t work all that well.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p class=p-text>Immelt was more of an outside CEO, eager to play public statesman in Washington, advising President Barack Obama, giving speeches and collecting awards, and not enough like Jack Welch, who was a roll-up-your-sleeves CEO who reveled in operational details, asked the hard questions, cultivated deep engagement with his leadership team, and never suffered fools gladly.</p><p><strong>Source:usatoday.com</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
