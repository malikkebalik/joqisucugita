She neither batted nor bowled in England’s 7-wicket victory in that match. In England’s 4th (and last) group-stage match, against the West Indies, she walked out to bat with England tottering at 48/5 in the 11th over.</li><li>The team further slumped to 50/6 in the same over. After this, Sophia top-scored for England (35 runs in 30 balls) and stitched a partnership of 58 runs for the 7th wicket with Anya Shrubsole to help her team reach a score of 108 runs in the 19th over. As of February 2023, this was still England’s highest partnership (and the 7th highest overall) for the 7th wicket in a WT20I match.</li><li>England finished at a total of 115 runs in this match and ultimately lost by 4 wickets. Despite the defeat, England (5 points) managed to qualify for the semi-final stage of the tournament by edging out South Africa (4 points). England eventually reached the final of the tournament where their nemesis, Australia, hammered them by 8 wickets.</li><li>In the 2019 season of the Women’s County Championship (the premier domestic first-class cricket competition in England and Wales), Sophia was the tournament’s leading run-scorer (451 runs in just 6 innings, including 2 centuries).</li><li>Her performance was crucial in helping Middlesex finish on top of the 2nd division of the championship and earning promotion to the first division in the following season. She was consequently named the club’s ‘Player of the Year’ and Sophia had also won this award in 2017.<br></li><li>In August 2021, she finished as the Southern Brave‘s highest run-getter (and the 3rd highest overall) – with 244 runs to her name in 9 innings – in the inaugural season of The Hundred. Her performances were vital in helping the Southern Brave finish in the 1st position in the league phase of the tournament – with a 7-1 win-loss record. Unfortunately, the team lost out to the Oval Invincibles in the final of the tournament.</li><li>In England’s last group stage game of the 2022 edition of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, against Bangladesh, Sophia scored a match-best 67 runs. England won the match by 100 runs and became the 3rd team to qualify for the semi-final stage of the tournament. She was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for her performance. England eventually reached the final of the tournament but was beaten by 71 runs by the Australian team that claimed its record-extending 7th title.</li><li>In September 2022, in the final match of the 2nd season of The Hundred, she top-scored (26 runs) for the Southern Brave but could not prevent a 2nd successive final-match defeat to the Oval Invincibles.</li><li>In February 2023, in the auction for the upcoming inaugural edition of the WPL (Women’s Premier League), Sophia was acquired by the Gujarat Giants for INR 60 lakhs. In March 2023, in the team’s 3rd match of the tournament, she smashed 65 runs off a mere 28 balls to help set up a mammoth target of 202 runs. It led to an 11-run win (the team’s first in the tournament) and Sophia was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for her blistering knock.</li><p>Featured Image by Sophia Dunkley / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqymqaCZlnqlwc2ko56xXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsophia-dunkley-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsophia-dunkley-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsophia-dunkley-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsophia-dunkley-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsophia-dunkley-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsophia-dunkley-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./treat-williams-relationships.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./treat-williams-relationships.html>Treat Williams relationships</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ryan-phillippe-bio-wiki.html>Ryan Phillippe Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ryan-phillippe-bio-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
