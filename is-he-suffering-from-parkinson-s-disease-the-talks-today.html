His love for hockey is obvious and infectious. And it is impossible to have a conversation with him without a smile on your face.</p><p>“Barry, we wish you well in this fight and know you will give it everything you have — as you always do.”</p><p>The news was first reported by Melrose’s broadcast partner, John Buccigross, who said on social media, “I’ve worked with Barry at ESPN for over a quarter century.
