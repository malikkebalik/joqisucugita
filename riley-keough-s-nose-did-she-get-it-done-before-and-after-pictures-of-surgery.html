Meet The Family Of Sister Devenity Perkins</p><p>In the 2010 movie “The Runaways,” Keough made her acting debut as artist and actress Lisa Marie Presley. Later, she appeared in supporting parts in movies including “Magic Mike,” “The Good Doctor,” and “Yellow.”</p><h2><span id=Riley_Keough8217s_Nose_Did_She_Get_It_Done_Before_And_After_Pictures_Of_Surgery>Riley Keough’s Nose: Did She Get It Done? Before And After Pictures Of Surgery</span></h2><p>After Riley shared a picture on Instagram, claims that she had a nose operation went viral. Keough’s nose seems to have transformed in recent years, as shown in before and after photos that have been widely shared online.</p><p>Some claim that she may have undergone nose surgery since her nose is thinner, straighter, and more defined.</p><p>Keough hasn’t confirmed whether or whether she’s had cosmetic surgery, however. Some believe that rather than surgery, her nose changes were the result of cosmetics, lighting, or even weight loss.</p><p>Also Read: Ana Rezende: Who Is She? Kate Moennig Married, Children, And Income</p><p>Last but not least, there is no proof Riley Keough has had any cosmetic surgery, including a nose job.</p><p>Even while some people have observed a change in the shape of her nose, it’s tough to identify whether it’s the result of surgery or naturally occurring changes.</p><h2><span id=Who_Are_the_Parents_of_Riley_Keough_Introducing_Danny_Keough_and_Lisa_Marie_Presley>Who Are the Parents of Riley Keough? Introducing Danny Keough and Lisa Marie Presley</span></h2><p>On May 29, 1989, Riley Keough was born in Santa Monica, California, in the United States. Her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, is the daughter of renowned singer and actor Elvis Presley, and her father, Danny Keough, is a musician.</p><p>She has a brother named Benjamin Storm Keough, two half-sisters, and a nephew.</p><p>Her early years were not typical. Her mother traveled, came from a wealthy family, and was engaged in a number of well-known relationships.</p><p>When Riley Keough’s parents, Danny Keough and Lisa Marie Presley, separated, Riley was five years old. She regularly moved and was thus shuttled back and forth between her parents.</p><p>After leaving her native Los Angeles, she briefly resided in Florida and also traveled to Hawaii. The familial situation of the young Keough, who claimed to InStyle that she “always felt out of place,” was anything from stable.</p><p>Nevertheless, she had a good childhood. She said about her Father, “My memories of him growing up were so colorful, crazy, and wonderful.” “You know, it was a great atmosphere there.”</p><p>She said that when she was with her less fortunate Father, she didn’t experience hunger but instead envied his simpler way of life and once told him that she “wanted[ed] to grow up and be poor” without comprehending “how profoundly awful it was.”</p><h2><span id=Does_Riley_Keough_have_a_spouse>Does Riley Keough have a spouse?</span></h2><p>Riley Keough and Australian stuntman Ben Smith-Petersen wed in 2015.</p><p>In 2012, the actress and Smith-Petersen crossed paths while shooting Mad Max: Fury Road. She is the daughter of Danny Keough, a musician, and the late Lisa Marie Presley. While doing re-shoots in Australia a year after their short on-location encounter, they began dating.</p><p>Instantly falling in love, Keough and the Australian stuntman confirmed their engagement in 2014. Less than a year later, the couple was married in February 2015.</p><p>Smith-Petersen has performed stunts in movies including Suicide Squad and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.</p><p>Just a few weeks before their wedding in the US, Keough and Smith-Petersen wed for the first time in Nepal, where they were constructing a school.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Adina, The Sister Of Athena Brownfield, Who?
