The film is based on the 1999 novel ‚ÄúThe Trench‚Äù by Steve Alten.</span></p><p><span>Plans for the sequel were announced in October 2018, and Ben Wheatley took over as director. Filming took place in various locations in Asia and Leavesden Studios in London from February to May 2022.</span></p><p><span>The world premiere of ‚ÄúMeg 2: The Trench‚Äù occurred at the Shanghai International Film Festival on June 9, 2023, with its release in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 4, 2023.</span></p><p><span>Despite receiving mostly negative reviews from critics, the film has managed to gross $142 million worldwide.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_To_Suyin_In_Meg_2></span><span>What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-Happened-To-Suyin-In-Meg-2.jpg alt="What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2?" width=800 height=500 title="What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2?

This revelation was made during a 10th-anniversary gathering of the Oceanic Institute, which was hosted by Juiming and attended by Jonas and Meiying. <span>What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2? What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2? What Happened To Suyin In Meg 2?</span></span></p><p><span>In his speech, Juiming discussed his history with megalodons and the institute, detailing his reasons for creating it and how he merged it with his father‚Äôs Zhang Oceanic Laboratory. He also mentioned that his father died during the original megalodon event and that Suyin had passed away before Meg 2.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The details surrounding Suyin‚Äôs death are limited, as a slide displayed during the party simply confirms that she passed away in 2021, three years after the events of the original movie.</span></p><p><span>The cause of her death and what she did in the years between The Meg and her passing are not disclosed, leaving questions about her relationship with Jonas.</span></p><p><span>It is unclear why the filmmakers chose to kill off Suyin instead of finding another explanation for her absence, as this makes it unlikely for Li Bingbing to reprise her role in a potential sequel.</span></p><p><span>Suyin‚Äôs death is barely mentioned by Jonas or Meiying, which seems odd considering its significance to the story. However, it‚Äôs possible that Li Bingbing may have retired from acting, which would explain the decision to kill off her character.</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Big screen, bigger shark. ü¶à Get your tickets NOW to see <a href=# rel=noopener>#Meg2</a> only in theaters August 4: <a href=#>https://t.co/8vwyCdIxO8</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TfAUqljegb</a></p><p>‚Äî Meg 2 (@MegMovie) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 25, 2023</a></p><p><strong><span>Read More ‚Äì <a href=# rel=noopener><span>Cricketer Sarfaraz Khan Wife Name</span></a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikkamytMDIp5mopJyuxLC7w2eaqKVfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSsrameu261zWaknp9dZ3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-suyin-in-meg-2-how-does-meg-2-explain-li-bingbing-s-absence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-suyin-in-meg-2-how-does-meg-2-explain-li-bingbing-s-absence.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-suyin-in-meg-2-how-does-meg-2-explain-li-bingbing-s-absence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-suyin-in-meg-2-how-does-meg-2-explain-li-bingbing-s-absence.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-suyin-in-meg-2-how-does-meg-2-explain-li-bingbing-s-absence.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-suyin-in-meg-2-how-does-meg-2-explain-li-bingbing-s-absence.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ai-generated-porn-on-the-rise-tech-giants-face-ethical-quandaries-amid-quality-improvements-as-the.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ai-generated-porn-on-the-rise-tech-giants-face-ethical-quandaries-amid-quality-improvements-as-the.html>AI-Generated Porn On The Rise: Tech Giants Face Ethical Quandaries Amid Quality Improvements As The</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tragic-death-of-15-year-old-teenager-in-raytown.html>Tragic Death of 15-Year-Old Teenager in Raytown</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tragic-death-of-15-year-old-teenager-in-raytown.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
